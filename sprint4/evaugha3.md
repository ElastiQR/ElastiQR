### What I accomplished

Once again, I had two main goals in mind for this sprint. For my first task, I wanted to focus on adding some customization options to the QR codes. Not only can you now change the color of the QR codes, but you can also add a logo to them. My other main task was to put the finishing touches on the user interface, and this was broken down into a few subtasks. First, I cleaned up the log in page and the sign up page, so the styling on those pages was consistent with the rest of the website. Then, I added a log out button to the navigation bar at the top, enabling users to log out more quickly and easily.
