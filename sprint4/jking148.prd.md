### Background

Most QR Codes as we know it today are static qr codes that cannot be changed ones they are produced. If someone or some organization were to print out qr codes and place around say a town, they would be stuck with whatever link they linked to those qr codes and if they wanted to change the link it would require a ton of work. In order to solve this problem we wanted to build a server that would house qr codes and their links and then allow the user to redirect those links after they placed by having our qr codes point to our server and then our server would redirect the user to the specified link that is provided.

### Project Overview

ElastiQR provides a way for users to maintain dynamic qr codes and to keep track of their qr code's traffic and manage them all in one place.
