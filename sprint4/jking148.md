### What I Accomplished

This sprint I was able to link the data that is portrayed on the home page of our app with the data that is being stored on our backend database to show the user how many times their qr codes have been used in the last five days. I did this by creating a new user service and creating a new route to the controller that was set up on the backend of our app and using the data on the graph on the main page.
