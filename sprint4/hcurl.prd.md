Product Name: ElastiQR

## Background
QR codes are becoming more widely used each day.  They are extremely useful, giving potential customers/users the ability to visit a website after one quick scan.  You can find QR codes all over the place, on websites, billboards, parking meters, and even Super Bowl commercials.  However, there is a major usability issue that can arise with non-digital QR codes.  Imagine your company paid big money to rent a billboard featuring a QR code to your website, and then, you have an issue with your url.  Now, the QR code that your company put on the billboard is useless.
