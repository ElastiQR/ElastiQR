* backend/src/controllers/qrController.js

## Accomplishments:
* By the time Sprint 4 came around, our group had accomplished much of what we set out to do at the start of the semester.  So, my goal for this Sprint was to clean up the backend routes and reduce redundancy.  I accomplished this goal by rewriting the qrUpdate and qrDelete controllers to where they are with the other controllers that enable different functionalities around QR Codes.  This will make it easier to debug the backend should any problems arise from the backend routes or controllers.
