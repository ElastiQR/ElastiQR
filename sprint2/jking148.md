### What I Accomplished

I was to modify the sign up page to disable the sign up button until the password requirements were met. My code was rewrote to better work with our needs later on in the spint. I also formatted the login page to look better for the user and I also modified the home page to portray dummy data to the user that can be modified later to show real time data to the user.
