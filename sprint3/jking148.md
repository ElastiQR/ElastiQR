### Files I worked on

* ElactiQR\frontend\src\components\Navbar.js
* ElactiQR\frontend\src\components\QRStatPage\index.js
* ElactiQR\frontend\src\components\Main\Main.js
* ElactiQR\frontend\src\services\user.service.js

### What I Accomplished

I was able to link a stat page into the QRDetailsPage this sprint and I was able to start linking the main page to the real data that is generated on the backend. This was a slower sprint for me due to other class loads as well as learning how to link data to the frontend for the first time but I did accomplish the majority of the data linking this sprint.
